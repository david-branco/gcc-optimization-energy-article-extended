Project Structure:
- rapl-read.c  : measurement software;
- read.sh      : bash script to automate the measurement process;
- charts.pl    : perl script to process the output;
- outputs      : files resulting from measurements;
- charts       : representation of the processed output;
- source_files : source code of measured software (without original input files -- because github size limit restriction);
